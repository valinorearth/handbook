# Remote

## Running a fully remote team

- Async communication = Communication that doesnâ€™t happen in real-time (for example, emails are a classic example of asynchronous communication. Slack messages, when not carried out as a full, real-time conversation, are also asynchronous.)
- Communicate, over-communicate. Did you say something before; please repeat it again, and again.
- Write, and write more. No, you don't have to worry about grammar-nazis. Good enough to get to the points, and primary message is enough. But hey, good writing have more to gain than anything other form of communication.
- The lesser meetings, we have, the better. In-fact, let's get to zero-meeting -- have a timer like "xx days since last meeting" or get a meeting dot-graph but in a scary way.

We need a Flowchart for what to do in what situations wrt Communication.
