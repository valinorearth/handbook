# Meetings

- Every meeting should have an agenda, which is distributed beforehand.
- Try to set a better title; short but descriptive enough. One should be able to remember what the meeting is for from the title.
- Always find way to make it easy for others -- time zones, holidays, etc.
- Try to avoid "urgent" and impromptu meetings.
