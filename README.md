# Sagri Handbook

> Sagri strives to fulfill farmersâ€™ life. We help farmers live a happier life. We give them easy-to-access credits and educate them in increasing their earning potential. We leverage satellite imagery and our proprietory soil sampling technology.

Sagri is a Remote-First company. Our team culture is inspired by the likes of [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/), [Stripe](https://stripe.com/), and other amazing companies.

This handbook is Work-in-Progress, a living guide, and is being written & built as we grow the team. We have an open culture, and we hope this open handbook will help prospects understand us before joining us. The team learns and unlearns from new people, we course correct, and we will contineously write the history of our company as we go on.

For those who know us, we are proud of our blend of quick prototypical Indian [Jugaad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jugaad), straightforwardness of the west, and the finesse, artistry, and craft of the Japanese.
