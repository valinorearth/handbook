# Sagri Team Handbook

---

> Sagri strives to fulfill farmersâ€™ life. We help farmers live a happier life. We give them easy-to-access credits and educate them in increasing their earning potential. We leverage satellite imagery and our proprietory soil sampling technology.

Sagri is a Remote-First company. Our team culture is inspired by the likes of [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/), [Stripe](https://stripe.com/), and other amazing companies.

This handbook is a living guide and is being written & built as we grow the team. We wanted an open culture, help prospects understand us before joining us. Learn from new people, and help course correct and write the history of our company as we go on.

For those who know us, we are proud of our blend of quick prototypical Indian [Jugaad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jugaad), straightforwardness of the west, that completes with a thorough finesse, artistry, and craft of the Japanese.
