{% callout type="warning" title="You're Early!" %}
This is the very early, a work-in-progress Handbook, yet to be released to the public. Anyway, please explore as we build out Handbook with the team and in public.
{% /callout %}


> Communicate, and over-communicate. Re-iterate to help others understand better. It is a marathon, not a sprint.

This handbook is work-in-progress, a living guide, and is being written & built as we grow the team. We have an open culture, and we hope this handbook will help prospects understand us before joining us. The team learns and unlearns from new people, course correct, and continuously writes our company's history as we go on.

We are proud to adopt the quick prototypical Indian Jugaad as a research tool, leverage straight-forwardness of the west, and the finesse, artistry, and craft of the Japanese.

## Culture

- No politics
- Full transparency
- Open-source and research-driven mindset
- Tech & Product first
- Products that people love to use
- Driven and Passionate colleagues
- Entrepreneurial mindset
- Good "Team" spirit
- No bullshitting
- "Let's do it" mentality

## Team

- Keep the team small. All doers, no talkers.
- Outsource/Delegate everything that isn’t core. Resist the urge to pick up that last dollar.
- Understand and care about Customer Service.
- People choose what to work on. Better they ship what they want than not ship what you want.
- No tasks longer than one week. You have to ship something into live production every week – worst case, two weeks. If you just joined, ship something.
- Peer-management. Promise what you’ll do in the coming week on internal communication. Deliver – or publicly break your promise – next week.

{% callout title="You should know!" %}
This is what a disclaimer message looks like. You might want to include inline `code` in it. Or maybe you’ll want to include a [link](/) in it. I don’t think we should get too carried away with other scenarios like lists or tables — that would be silly.
